=============================

Warm up Android app project for compsci 408 class at Duke


Warm-up Project

This individual project is intended to get you up to speed before you begin working on your client app. The goal is to install the development tools and get a basic app deployed onto a device so that everyone has an understanding of the app deployment process.


Deliverables

1. Create Accounts, Take Survey, and Install Software
2. Allow users to login to your app
3. Allow users to retrieve and display data from a remote database

You will not "submit" projects as in other CompSci classes. Instead, you will be graded on what is in the master branch of your repository at 8am the morning of the due date. Your team is responsible for ensuring that all files are correctly pushed to the repository.


Details

To get started, setup your machine for mobile app development (iOS or Android)

Phase 1

- Create developer accounts
  - Create a GitHub account (if you do not already have one)
  - Create an Apple Developer account (not necessary for Android or Web development)
  - For each account, complete the online profile, including an email address, so that the course staff knows who you are (a picture would be nice :) In other words, you can use whatever screen name you want, but your actual name or Duke NetID has to be associated with the account somewhere.

- Download IDE software
  - Xcode for iOS through the Mac App Store
  - Android plug-in for Eclipse
  - Web development for Eclipse


Phase 2

- Create any basic app (iOS or Android)
- Deploy app to device (iOS or Android)
  - For Apple iOS:
    - Email course staff the UUID of your device
    - Apple will send you a Developer Invitation
    - Once you accept the invitation, request a Development Certificate
    - Instructors will approve certificate, register your device, and connects it to the class Provisioning Profile
    - You can then download and install the Provisioning Profile in Xcode
- Add the requirement that users login to your basic app to be able to see any content


Phase 3

- Details about Duke database coming soon
